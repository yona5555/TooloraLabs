## Drawing + table cards: no empty gaps (Yousef 2026-10-17)
This replaces any earlier "always stack" or "always side-by-side" wording.

- GOAL = no empty gaps in any card. Applies to every card holding a drawing (chart, scene, map, diagram, 3D, preview) plus a table, controls or info panel. (1) Card full with no visible empty space → DO NOT TOUCH IT, whatever its layout (e.g. weather "10-day forecast"). (2) Side-by-side card with empty space (one part much shorter, blank area under it) → STACKED: drawing on top at full card width, table/panel below at full card width in a 3/2/1-column grid by screen size, worked-example formula in a full-width bottom row (e.g. weather "Next 48 hours"). (3) Stacked card with empty space (drawing or controls in a narrow centred column with blank sides) → SIDE-BY-SIDE: drawing on one side, table/controls on the other, both filling the card (e.g. text tool "Layout playground"). (4) A card that had no gaps at commit 911cf931 but has gaps now is restored to its 911cf931 layout. Detection (measure, never screenshots): `apps/web/scripts/card-gap-check.mjs` at 1440px in ar and en flags side-by-side parts differing by more than 30% in height, and stacked content using less than 75% of the card inner width. Always: labels never clipped, drawings readable (axis text >= 12px), mirrored for RTL, light/dark, all 6 locales, mobile <= 768px stacked naturally with no gaps.
- Approved full card, do not touch: weather "10-day forecast".
- Stacked reference: weather "Next 48 hours".
- Side-by-side reference: text tool "Layout playground".
